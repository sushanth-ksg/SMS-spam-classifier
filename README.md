## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline:
- Text preprocessing with NLTK
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training with Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Deployment using Gradio + Hugging Face Spaces

It takes a raw SMS message and predicts whether it's spam using a simple web interface.
